Cython files allowing acces to the optimized BLAS routines available in scipy.linalg.

There is now a new and much improved version of this code included in SciPy 0.16.
The version there corrects many of the typos in the declarations here and provides Cython wrappers for the vast majority of the routines available in BLAS and LAPACK.
Users are encouraged to use the interface provided there instead.
